# NOW ABOUT THE GAME

- This game is playable on any device as long as that device has a brouser in it and supports touch display or keyboard-mouse
- In future i will make it for controller also but i don't have any intrest to make it so but i can i do it if i am sitting jobless in my room :)
- We have tried to make it a story based game but maybe our story is not that good we are sorry for it.

## ABOUT USAGE

See i build this game for the school competition and i dont care about the codes anyway. So use the codes anywhere you want remix it or show it in you school competition just don't forget to write special thanks to "Yushi".
Anyway i have written everything a normal person need to know to run the game but if you are a developer and wanna understand the game so just read it by your self idc explaining here this project has fked me a lot so i am not bothered to explain it.
Also ya i used heavily used ai to complete this project becuase its not possible to build this game in 1 month. this game took me 88 hrs to build so without the help of ai it wasnt possible to do it so. 

Any doubt about this Game just let me know!
